# Breakout Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Breakout game using object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## Description

The game is built using pure JavaScript and HTML5 canvas for rendering. The game logic is encapsulated in a JavaScript file (`breakout.js`), which is linked to the HTML file (`breakout.html`).

The game board is a 480x320 pixel canvas. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and tries to bounce a ball against a number of bricks at the top of the screen. The goal is to break all the bricks without letting the ball pass the paddle.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply open the `breakout.html` file in your web browser. The game will start immediately.

## Dependencies

The game uses Bootstrap for basic styling. The Bootstrap JavaScript bundle is linked in the HTML file via a CDN.
